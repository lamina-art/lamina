    <h2>About Us</h2>
    
    <p class= "paragraph"> Founded in 1971 by Neuroscientists Dr. Henrik Slokov and Dr. Viktor Petrov, we have
    spent decades dedicated to improving the intellectual abilities of children. 
    Through our research and innovation, we have developed extraordinary methods to boost a child's IQ. 
    Our method includes periodic, timed, observation of our art pieces which are intentionally and strategically 
    constructed to open up all of your child's latent mental ability. We create art that is scientifically proven to boost a child's IQ at extraordinary levels.</p>
